## Basic repo setup for final project

*Engineering Success: Predicting Studentsâ€™ Academic Dropout and Graduation Chances* aims to predict whether a student will remain enrolled at university after two semesters, whether they will drop out, or whether they will graduate based on a number of academic and personal characteristics. 

## Folders

- `data/`: can find raw data with codebook, split data, and resampling data (obtained using v-fold cross-validation)
- `scripts/`: can find scripts where work was completed
- `results/`: can find 12 models fit to the training data, the final fit on the boosted tree kitchen sink recipe, final accuracy results, the correlation plot used in the EDA, and the ROC comparison table used to determine the final winning model
- `memos/`: can find Progress Memo 1 and Progress Memo 2 QMD and html files
- `recipes/`: can find kitchen sink recipe (for tree and non-tree based models) and feature engineered recipe (for tree and non-tree based models)
